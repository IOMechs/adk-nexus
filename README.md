## ‚ö° Instantly Test Your Agent
To see how your agent performs right now, use our hosted version here:¬†[adk-nexus.dev.iomechs.com](http://adk-nexus.dev.iomechs.com). A modal will prompt for your agent's credentials.


## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the chatbot up and running.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.9 or higher
*   A deployed agent on [Vertex AI Agent Engine](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/agent-engine/overview)

### 1. Set up your environment variables

To configure your application, you'll need to create a `secrets.toml` file within a `.streamlit` directory.

First, copy the example secrets file:

```bash
cp secrets.example.toml .streamlit/secrets.toml
```

Next, open `.streamlit/secrets.toml` and populate it with your specific Google Cloud and agent information:

```toml
# .streamlit/secrets.toml

# --- Required Configuration ---
RESOURCE_ID = "your-agent-engine-resource-id"
LOCATION = "your-gcp-region"

# --- Optional Configuration ---
CHATBOT_NAME = "your-chatbot-name" # Defaults to "ADK Chatbot"
```

### 2. Configure Google Cloud authentication

To securely connect to your Vertex AI agent, you need to create a Google Cloud service account.

1.  **Navigate to Service Accounts:** In the Google Cloud Console, go to **IAM & Admin ‚Üí Service Accounts** for your project.
2.  **Create Service Account:** Click on **+ CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT**.
3.  **Details:** Give your service account a descriptive name (e.g., "ADK Chatbot Service Account").
4.  **Permissions:** Grant the "Vertex AI User" role to this service account.
5.  **Create Key:**
    *   Find your newly created service account in the list.
    *   Click the three-dot menu on the right and select **Manage keys**.
    *   Click on **ADD KEY** ‚Üí **Create new key**.
    *   Choose **JSON** as the key type and click **Create**. A JSON key file will be downloaded to your computer.
6.  **Convert and Add to Secrets:**
    *   Open the downloaded JSON file.
    *   You will need to convert the content of this JSON file into a TOML-compatible format for Streamlit. You can use an online converter for this.
    *   Paste the resulting TOML content into your `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file under the `[gcp_service_account]` section, ensuring there are no line breaks in the private key.

Your completed `secrets.toml` should look like this:

```toml
# .streamlit/secrets.toml

RESOURCE_ID = "your-agent-engine-resource-id"
LOCATION = "your-gcp-region"
CHATBOT_NAME = "your-chatbot-name" # Optional, defaults to "ADK Chatbot"

[gcp_service_account]
type = "service_account"
project_id = "xxx"
private_key_id = "xxx"
...
```

## üíª Running the App Locally

### Activate virtual environment

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the app

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Your chatbot should now be running locally!

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deploy to Streamlit Cloud

1.  **Push to GitHub:** Ensure your code, including the `requirements.txt` file, is pushed to a GitHub repository.
2.  **New App on Streamlit Cloud:** Go to [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) and click on **New app**.
3.  **Connect Your Repo:** Select your GitHub repository and the correct branch.
4.  **Configure App:** Set the "Main file path" to `app.py`.
5.  **Add Secrets:** In the "Advanced settings," copy the entire content of your local `secrets.toml` file and paste it into the "Secrets" section.
6.  **Deploy:** Click **Deploy**. Streamlit Cloud will handle the rest, and your chatbot will be live at a shareable URL.
